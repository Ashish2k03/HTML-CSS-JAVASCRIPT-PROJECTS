# Starbucks Landing Page

This project is a **replication** of a Starbucks landing page I saw on my sir's GitHub repository. While the original version was built using Bootstrap, I recreated it from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Additionally, I included animated coffee glasses using **Animate.css** and social media icons with **FontAwesome**.
